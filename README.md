#Gotta Guess 'Em All!

##Chosen Idea
We decided to put a creative twist on the classic Hangman game by incorporating content from the Pokémon API (pokeapi.co), allowing users to guess the names of Pokémon. The word to guess will be drawn from the API using a random number generator, leveraging the extensive database of over 1,000 Pokémon. 

##Target Audience
Our target audience consists of individuals who are familiar with Pokémon. People may have fond memories of the classic Game Boy games and their nostalgic aesthetic.
